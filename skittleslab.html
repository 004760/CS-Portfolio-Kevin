<h1>What emotions first come to mind when you eat different color skittles?</h1>
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>We collected data by going around lunch and giving them some skittles as well as asking them to take the survey on schoology. We got 138 resoponses!<p>

 <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p> We were very set on using pie graphs because we know that it was the most clear and consise way of seeing what people thought of each color skittle.<br> We saw that people tended to think sweet for red skittles around 33%, this was not a blowout though, happy was close behind at 30%.<br> These are some trends we found in yellow, except that sad, depressed won.<br> We thought this was due to the sour tast and sour seemed to be more of a negative taste.<br> These are the clear patterns we saw but the rest is more vague and hard to inerpret, so we will leave that up to viewer opinion and thought. </p> 
<h2>Visuals</h2>
 <p>We wanted to use pie graphs as a way to find what people thought about skittles in terms of their color.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall Green and Yellow skittles made people feel sad and depressed as the other colors did not. <br>We found that When people eat red skittles they first think sweet over savory,happy and sad or depressed.<br>
When people eat orange skittles they feel happy. We were wondering why doesn't the Skittles company put more red and orange because they tend to recieve a positive response.<br> But after doing extensive research we found that they try to have a same amount for each color every time.<br> This puzzled us at first, but then we remebered that what sets skittles apart is the variety. so wether you like certain colors or not you are always getting variety.<br> That is part of the fun.<br> So next time you dig into a bag of skittles you are going to get a lot of different feelings as well as the full taste of the rainbow </p>
